## Citro take-home test

This is a blank React Native (Expo) project. Your task is to implement a movie search application using TMDB or any other similar apis.
Feel free to use any libraries as you see fit, UI or otherwise (state management, data fetching, etc).

Expo-router and Nativewind are already installed and configured. If this is not your preference, feel free to use a different navigation library or styling solution as you see fit.

Please spend no more than a couple hours on this. Designs need not be polished, a basic wireframe-like UI is sufficient.

### Requirements
- Customers should be able to search for movies by title
- Search result list should display metadata for each movie
- clicking on a movie should display the details about that movie
    - this can be in as a modal or a separate details screen
